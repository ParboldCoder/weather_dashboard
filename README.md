# weather_dashboard

## Description
<br>
As part of this weeks challenge I built a weather dashboard using the API from "OpenWeather" for a 5 day forecast.
<br>
<br>
I implemented an extra feature to provide local weather when the user loads the page "Allowing Location Access" whne prompted by the user browser.
<br>
<br>
I learned a lot of new information and how to pull information from the API using the array and the "file names" the api uses for each section.
<br>
I also struggled understanding multiple lines of information from the array within the API so I could collate the weather for 5 days.
<br>
<br>
For some unknown reason I am unable to get the page to work LIVE, but it will work perfectly fine when I test on "live server" from my own desktop.
